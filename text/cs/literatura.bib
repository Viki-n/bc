title="Small is beautiful: In defense of the small-N design",
journal="Psychonomic Bulletin {\&} Review",

month="Mar",

abstract="The dominant paradigm for inference in psychology is a null-hypothesis significance testing one. Recently, the foundations of this paradigm have been shaken by several notable replication failures. One recommendation to remedy the replication crisis is to collect larger samples of participants. We argue that this recommendation misses a critical point, which is that increasing sample size will not remedy psychology's lack of strong measurement, lack of strong theories and models, and lack of effective experimental control over error variance. In contrast, there is a long history of research in psychology employing small-N designs that treats the individual participant as the replication unit, which addresses each of these failings, and which produces results that are robust and readily replicated. We illustrate the properties of small-N and large-N designs using a simulated paradigm investigating the stage structure of response times. Our simulations highlight the high power and inferential validity of the small-N design, in contrast to the lower power and inferential indeterminacy of the large-N design. We argue that, if psychology is to be a mature quantitative science, then its primary theoretical aim should be to investigate systematic, functional relationships as they are manifested at the individual participant level and that, wherever possible, it should use methods that are optimized to identify relationships of this kind.",

title="Gabor filters as texture discriminator",
journal="Biological Cybernetics",
year="1989",
month="Jun",
day="01",
volume="61",
number="2",
pages="103--113",
abstract="The present paper presents a model for texture discrimination based on Gabor functions. In this model the Gabor power spectrum of the micropatterns corresponding to different textures is calculated. A function that measures the difference between the spectrum of two micropatterns is introduced and its values are correlated with human performance in preattentive detection tasks. In addition, a two stage algorithm for texture segregation is presented. In the first stage the input image is transformed via Gabor filters into a representation image that allows discrimination between features by means of intensity differences. In the second stage the borders between areas of different textures are found using a Laplacian of Gaussian operator. This algorithm is sensitive to energy differences, rotation and spatial frequency and is insensitive to local translation. The model was tested by means of several simulations and was found to be in good correlation with known psychophysical characteristics as texton based texture segregation and micropattern density sensitivity. However, this simple model fails to predict human performance in discrimination tasks based on differences in the density of ``terminators''. In this case human performance is better than expected.",
